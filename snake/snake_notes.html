Snake pseudo code

my approach thinking
	Options for the game board
		1. canvas and we can manipulate all visual elements using the built in x and y
		2. divs confined to a specified width
		3. a table with a bunch of cells
	The snake
		The snake is an array of coordinates
		Motion is faked by painting each of the coordinates
		Every render the coordinates on the head and tail get updated for the given direction

Needs to get made
	Render the board
		X by X cells
	Render the snake
		each segment occupies a cell on the board
		increases in size whenever it eats some shit
	Render the food
		disapears when it's eaten
	Game loop
		renders the snake every X ms
		breaks if the snake runs into something
