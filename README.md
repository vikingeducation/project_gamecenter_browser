## About the game

The player controls a square, on the bordered display. As it moves forward, it leaves a trail behind, resembling a moving snake. In this snake scheme, the snake has a specific length, so there is a moving tail a fixed number of units away from the head. The player loses when the snake runs into the screen border, or its tail (trying to reverse directions without an intermediate direction change will cause you to hit your tail, so be careful!).

The object of the game is to grow your snake until it fills all available squares.
To grow your snake, eat food by running into the black squares with the head of the snake.
